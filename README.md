# Diwali Sales Analysis using EDA

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to analyze Diwali sales data with the aim of enhancing both customer experience and sales performance. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for tasks including data cleaning, processing, and deriving valuable insights from the provided dataset.and I Have used Jupyter Notebook as the platform for this project.

## Data Sources
Diwali_sales data: The primary dataset used for the project is the "DiwaliSales_RawData.csv" file, which contains all the information about Diwali sales.

## Tools and Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

### Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we have to perform the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspecting the data
2. Remove Unwanted or Unnecessary columns 
3. Data cleaning

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries and got insights to 

*Improve customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender and age groups

*Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands


 ### Conclusion 
Married women of age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra, and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. Also, the product with product id P00265242 is sold the most.
